The software will ask for GPS location information and then you can set a proximity in which to activate an event.

# Event can be used to / Actions which will be created #
  * automatic profile change, phone will change the profile when you arrive to gps location, for example: you arrive to home and the mode will be "silent"
  * an audio alarm
  * on-screen notification
  * automatic sms message
  * automatic instant message
  * automatic voice call
  * automatic timestamp to calendar, so that you can see when you arrive to work and when you leave from work ;)

# Possible Usages #
  * Location Aware Profiles
  * Proximity alert to a container
  * Automatic workhour reporting
  * Audio and Visual Notification when navigating
  * Maybe it could be a part of a geocaching software also :)
  * Or when you are going to the summer cottage, your mobile can automatically inform your friends to warm up the sauna ;9
  * Security Company utility, A security guard will get the location where he should be from security center and the security center will get a notice when guard has arrived to location and also a notice when the guard has left the location. Could be used to see if a door/gate has to opened for a guard, that the mobile which guard is carrying will send an automated message when at the door/gate.

# Utter Description #
## Why ##
I think the _Location Aware Profiles_ is the one feature which I miss from my own mobile phone. In my opinion the extra work to remember to switch the profile of the phone isn't needed when this software is ready. When this software is combined to pseudosatellites then it can be used inside the office building to switch the profile when you enter to the meeting room. The other thing is that I want a software which will collect the information when I arrive to work and when I leave from work.

## When ##
I will make the first draft samples at the weekend. So be tuned ;)

## To Whom? What? ##
The main focus is to give tools to the application developers. The secondary focus is the working application set.

# Questions? #
If you have any questions at all, visit the discussion group and ask.

# P.S #
I will provide all samples which I will create to the svn. So that you can see the code and make things a bit better than me. ;p
