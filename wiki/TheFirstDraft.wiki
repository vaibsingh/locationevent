= Introduction =

So the idea is to use _Location Manager_ to provide the current location. Which will be used to calculate if an event is to be raised.


= The first draft =

== Notes ==
 * All features are subject to change :)
 * Remember to add support for i18N, take care of this at the detailed design
 * Confirm all needed/used parts of this document
 * Maybe the correct name would have been _Location Aware Profiles_
 * I will start the coding process at the weekend, so be tuned, because this document WILL change

== Feature Description ==
The idea of the software is to monitor current location in the background. The first version of the software will send a notifications to user about the current location, when the software detects that the current location is 100m to a waypoint. At the sametime the software will _mute_ the phone when close to the waypoint.
